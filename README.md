# 30-Days-Of-ML


###  **About the challenge**:

Being passionate about machine learning i've decided to challenge myself. I was scrolling through Kaggle and stumbled upon the [30 Days of ML](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml) challenge. 30 Days of ML challenge is a challenge based on studying ML for about and hour a day and receiving assignments and leaading to a competition.


## **Motivation**: 

Doing this challenge, I want to build a foundation and master the basics. I believe starting from stratch will help me do that. At the end of the 30 days, I hope to have a rich portfolio of code and projects and have a great understanding of the topics and ground-breaking reserach. Most importantly I want to contribute to the machine learning community.

### **Aim**:

My aim and focus through out the process is to learn as much as I can with the material I can get my hands on. While also providing helpful links and laying out some tips and tricks.

### **Goal**:

- Build a solid foundation
- Master the workflow of an ML engineer
- Display knowledge by selecting a random dataset at the end of the 30 days and creating models and visualizations
